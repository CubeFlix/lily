# lily
A lightweight secure network file server written in Go.

## Notice
Lily is still a work in progress, and many important features have still not been implemented.

## Internal Structure
Lily is composed of a `server` and a `client`. The `server` package contains code for the main server implementation, and the CLI (command line interface). The `client` package contains code for a Go API and a CLI interface.

Lily runs via the Lily protocol. TBD
